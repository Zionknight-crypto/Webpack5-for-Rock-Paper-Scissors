# Webpack 5.93.0: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game.

This repo is for anyone wishing to utilize the current basic **webpack 5 bundler set up**. If you want to learn about Webpack then I recommend you check out their official docs at [webpack.js.org](https://webpack.js.org). If you want to see a video tutorial then I highly recommend [Traversy Media by Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGNcSuwBZs). Please note that from my own experience there can be some information which is outdated. By this I mean that even from documentation I sometimes ran into errors when doing things by the book and the video tutorial is fantastic but not a very recent example. Always set out to try things yourself and figure out what is working and what may be causing errors. Special thanks to [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) for initially offering boiler plate for this task during my Frontend Engineering programme.
